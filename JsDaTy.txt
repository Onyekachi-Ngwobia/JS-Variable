JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data namely: numbers and strings and many others.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If a number is put in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

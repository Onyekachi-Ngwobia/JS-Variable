Declaring a JavaScript Variable

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

We declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

var carName;
or:
let carName;

After the declaration, if the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).

To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:

carName = "Volvo";

You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:

let carName = "Volvo";

In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.

Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":

see HTML


Noting that:

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
